# liri-node-app

This project is a command line node app that takes in user commands and performs the appropriate task. The resulting data is displayed back to the user on the command line. The program accepts the following commands:

1. `concert-this` "ARTIST NAME"
   This command uses the Bands In Town API to search for upcoming concert event information. It returns to the user:
   *Name of the venue
   *Venue location
   \*Event date

2. `spotify-this-song` "SONG TITLE"
   This command uses the Spotify API to search for song information.
3. `movie-this` "MOVIE TITLE"
   This command uses the OMDB API to search for movie information.
4. `do-what-it-says`
   This command imports commands from a text file and then does what the command says!
